# Squigglemoji: Full instructions
### About
This project is enforced by Apache Licence 2.0. This project's aim is to make emoji pictures in place for typing out unicode that give you a headache just to remember! This project is made with and based on open-source software OpenMoji.
### Installation
Go to releases, navigate to the first version you see, then click on Assets, download the .zip file, and your site is ready for Squigglemoji implemetion!
### Implementation
Now that you have the .zip file, you need to extract it. For Windows, go on the top for "Extract", which will extract the emojis. For Chrome OS, the .zip file acts as a mounted drive, you need to copy all of the contents to the Downloads folder as seen on first arrival on the Files app. On your text editor, paste the following code:
`<img src="smiling_face.png" width="50" height="60">`
You need to move the .htm(l) file to where the images are located.
